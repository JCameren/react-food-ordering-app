# WIP

In this app project, I used what I had learned previously from my other lectures and applied the useReducer and useContext for more complex state management.

At this point, I have a clear understanding of the useState hook and useEffect hook. I will admit I was able to keep up with the instructor when he created a reducer to manage and update the state for the cart. It did however get complicated towards the end when he made the logic in the reducer more complex because he wanted to render the cart items a certain way. I definitely have a better understand of the useReducer hook, but that was little too advanced in my opinion. Seems like something one would understand how to create with time, because although I understand the hook better now, that was definitely something I wouldn't have thought of doing. I more or less get the useContext hook, it is just something that contains state snapshots for components to reference, and the reducer runs dispatch functions inside of the handler functions, for this project, and updates the state in the "store." It was like I thought, it can sort of get rid of needing to prop drill everywhere to pass data, so that's pretty cool.

I will definitely reference this in the future since it has an add/remove feature as action types in the reducer that are pretty good.(He lost me there.)

I will also adopt a different file structure just because the way he set up things/kept files organized was far better than what I was doing, and you can definitely see how I started changing it if you look at the file structure. So that's a good takeaway!

*This will not work if you fork it for your own b/c of file paths from my computer. It is probably something on my end. For some imports they wouldn't work unless I did it that way. :(
